The device consists of a dual three-link manipulator with 2 actuators and 2 end-effectors on 
perpendicular axes.
The design process starts with the study of the 2D model of the robot and the evaluation of 
its kinematics. The workspace of the robot is then explored and, after considering several 
concepts, the most suitable design is assessed and explained.
